**goka-demo**

My own demo project to study the Go language and the most common use-case libraries (at least most common for me):
* interaction with Apache Kafka (consume/produce messages)
* exposing a REST API
* saving entities to a database

This project focuses on exposing 2 endpoints (GET/POST of a string), and producing/consuming those strings on Kafka.
