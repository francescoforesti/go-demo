**go-demo**

My own demo project to study the Go language and some libraries for the most common use cases (at least for me):
* interaction with Apache Kafka (using sarama)
* exposing a REST API (using gin)
* saving entities to a database (to be added)

At the moment project focuses on exposing 2 endpoints (GET/POST of a simple message), and producing/consuming those messages on Kafka.
